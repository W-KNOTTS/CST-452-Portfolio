**Project Summary:**

This project was created to replace my older media player solutions. Newer media players track users and their habits, 
creating a finger print to target their users for sales, media, and just the general value that comes with the collected 
data points to be sold to others for use. This media player has that in mind by creating a modular and clean environment 
for users to enjoy their media. The application will be built in C# WPF because of its native media playback capability 
but at the cost of being a Windows only application. UWP and JAVA were too restrictive and required stacks of 3rd party 
libraries. With WPF only three libraries are needed to read/ write the metadata of the selected file, rip music from CDs and
get online track details. C# WPF meets all the requirements of the media player app and will be used moving forward for 
this project.
